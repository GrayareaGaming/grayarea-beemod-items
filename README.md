# Grayarea's [BEEMod](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4) Items

Currently this collection has just one item: my take on the Schrödinger Cube.

## Schrödinger Cube

This cube type was included in the game files of the [Peer Review DLC](https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Peer_Review) but was never released in a usable form.
