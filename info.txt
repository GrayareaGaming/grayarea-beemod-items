	"Description"
		{
		"" "This take on the Schrödinger Cube essentially behaves like both a laser catcher and emitter which can be connected to or from any item."
		"" ""
		"" "To create the traditional pair of Schrödinger Cubes, connect each cube to its partner (A → B and B → A)."
		"" ""
		"" "Other connection patterns are also supported, such as loops (A → B → C → A), using the cube as a catcher connected to a bridge/funnel, or as a portable laser activated by a button or other item."
		"" ""
		"" "* The _Camera_ item property creates a monitor when carrying a cube showing the view from the linked cube. See the _Style/Item Properties_ page for this and other options."
		"" "* _Start Enabled_ flips the laser emitter state as with a normal emitter."
		"" "* _Start Active_ changes the input logic from AND (the default) to OR. When set, any input to the cube will activate the laser emitter."
		"" "* _Start Reversed_ causes the cube to _not_ fizzle the cube it's connected to when fizzled itself."
		"" "* To place a dropper version, use the [timer to link them](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/wiki/Default-PeTI-Items#cubes). Note: placing the cube under a dropper without using timer linkage currently does not work due to a BEE issue."
		"" "* The _Cube Coloriser_ is supported, although the effect is subtle. Due to a known issue, it may be necessary to edit at least one color in _Style/Item Properties_ for this to work."
		"" "* The cube's laser emitter follows the _Laser Auto-Aim_ property in _Default Test Elements_. It's recommended to turn this off due to these cube containing a laser catcher."
